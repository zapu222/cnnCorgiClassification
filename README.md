# Python, Corgi Classification with CNN's - Zachary Pulliam

This code was written in order to implement flexible convolutional neural networks from scratch that will be used to classify 
images of two types of Corgis, Cardigan and Pembroke, from the ImageNet dataset.

The CNN class can be used on any other dataset as long as the input images and output classes are formatted correctly based on that of
the Corgi dataset in datasets.py.

A full example as well as metrics can be cretaed in tutorial.ipynb.
